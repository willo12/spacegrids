"""The main classes used in Spacegrids are Field, Gr and Coord. They represent data defined on grids and reflect Netcdf data. Similar classes are Ax and AxGr.

Gr (grid) objects are constructed from Coord (coordinate) objects as tuples, and inherit methods related to the tuple members from the Membered class. Similarly, AxGr (axis grid) objects are constructed as tuples with methods from Ax (axis, e.g. X or Y) objects. Field objects contain a grid attribute (a Gr object) and a ndarray value attribute of data defined on that grid (e.g. spatially distributed temperature measurements). Vfield objects (vector fields) are tuples of Field objects with inherited Membered methods.

The fieldcls module contains the following classes:

Coord
-----

Represents distrete coordinate collection in a direction (e.g. 'depth' may contain the points 10m depth, 20m depth,...). Corresponds to a dimension variable in Netcdf.

Gr
--

Represents Coord grids. Consists of a tuple of Coord objects, with additional inherited Membered and other methods.

Ax
--

Axis. Represents direction: e.g. the longitudinal direction, X, or the vertical, Z. Coord objects have an attribute that points to an Ax object, representing its direction.

AxGr
----

Same as Gr, but containing Ax objects instead of Coord as members. The difference is mainly in the multiplication methods.

Field
-----

Represents a dataset defined on a grid. Contains a grid attribute that is a Gr object, the grid on which the data is defined. This allows correct behaviour under Field operations such as multiplication.

# -------- Coord  ----------------

class Coord(Directional, Valued):
  """
  Represents distrete coordinate collection in a direction (e.g. a 'depth' Coord that contains points 10m depth, 20m depth,...). Corresponds to a dimension variable in Netcdf.

  Coord objects have a name, value (generally a numpy array) and units. The value of a Coord is a 1D ndarray containing location points (e.g. 50 degrees north). Coord is the basic building block of Gr (grid) objects.
  Examples of Coord objects are xt or yt, corresponding to the tracer grid cells in the x and y directions. Coord objects have a corresponding dual. For xt it is xt_edges and vice versa. The dual generally contains the edges of the grid cells. If no dual argument is given, the Coord object is its own dual.

  Coord objects c1 and c2 are considered weakly the same, where c1.weaksame(c2) yields True, when the name, value (numpy array) and units attributes are equal.

  Being a container of Coord objects and composed from them into a multidimensional construct, the Gr object (grid) is closely related to Coord. A shorthand for Gr construction is via multiplication of Coord objects. If two Coord objects coord1 and coord2 are not equivalent (generally when they point in different directions, e.g. X and Y), their product is a shorthand for the creation of a 2D grid coord1*coord2 = Gr((coord1, coord2)). By induction, products containing n elements yield Gr objects of dimension <=n. See class documentation.

  An abstract equivalence relationship is inherited from the Directional classs where two objects are equivalent when they have the same 'associative' attribute (pointing to an Associative object). This relationship is generally used to indicate whether two Directional objects have the same direction (e.g. X,Y), but could represent other relationships depending on the user.


  The Coord class contains methods related to distances, with the following dependencies. dist is fundamental. delta_dist depends on dist. der depends on dist. d depends on dual Coord and delta_dist. vol depends on d.


  Attributes:
    axis: (Ax) axis along which Coord is defined.
    dual: (Coord) link to other Coord object, usually representing edges of cells.
    direction: (str) name of direction in which Coord is defined.
    equivs: (list of Coords) list of links to equivalent Coord objects. Usually coincides with all Coord's defined in same direction.
    len: (int) length of the value attribute (ndarray)
    long_name: (str) a longer description. Usually taken from identically named variable in Netcdf file.
    metadata: (dict) name vs value dict of metadata to save into Netcdf. Usually obtained from Netcdf read.
    name: (str) name of object (e.g. 'xt' or 'depth').
    nbytes: (int) approximate memory usage of Coord object.
    strings: (list of strings or None) str labels for coord points. If not None, needs to be of same length as value
    units: (str) units (e.g. "meter")
    value: (Numpy ndarray) 1D array corresponding to spatial points (e.g. 10 degrees S for a point).

  Examples:    
    >>> coord1 = sg.fieldcls.Coord(name = 'test1',value =np.array([1.,2.,3.]) ,axis =sg.fieldcls.Ax('X'),direction ='X', metadata = {'hi':5} )

  g = Gr((c0,c1,c2)) creates a Gr object g from a tuple, say (c0,c1,c2), of Coord objects, say c0, c1, c2. Indexing is done as in tuples: g[0] is c0 etc.

  Gr objects can be built via multiplication as follows: c1*c2 yields Gr((c1,c2)), a subspace of the above Gr object c0*c1*c2. For instance, depth*latitude*longitude represents a 3 dimensional grid, and is essentially a Coord tuple of length 3 with extra methods.

  The Gr class provides compact methods for instance for regridding, integration and taking derivatives of Fields, and the calculation of volumes.

  Grid arithmetic: multiplication and division of Gr objects yields new Gr objects, as described in the documentation for __div__ and __mul__.

class Field(Valued):
  """
  Represents a dataset defined on a grid. 

  Field objects contain a grid (a Gr object) attribute and a ndarray value attribute of data defined on that grid.

  The call method allows fields to act as function defined on grid objects.
  For a 2D scalar corresponding to Field T, say defined on grid yt*xt, T(dy*dx) yields a 2D array of the scalar values.

  If Field T is naturally defined on grid yt*xt, then T(zt*yt*xt) yields a 3D array b such that b[k,:,:] = T(yt*xt) for all possible k.


  If g is a Gr (grid) or Coord object, left or right multiplication of a Field  object F with Gr Coord results in the grid-cell width weighted summing of the Field over the coords in the multiplicant g (integration, via g.vsum method), resulting in a smaller dimension Field.

  If g is a Coord object, g.der(F) yields the derivative of F along g. g.vcumsum(F) yields the grid cell width-weight cumulative sum of F over g.

  Shortcuts: if g is a Coord object, g^F yields the derivative of F along g (via g.der method). g|F yields the grid cell width-weight cumulative sum of F over g (primitive, via g.vcumsum).

  two fields F1, F2 are considered weakly the same, F1.weaksame(F2) yields True, when their name, value (an numpy array) and Gr (grid) attribute are equal, unless they contain nan values.

  NOTE: multiplication works a bit different from addition at the moment. Addition will go ahead even when coords in the grids are differently named (or have other non-value attributes differ) as long as the value (the coord points) are the same: then the (left and right) coords are considered equal. Multiplication treats them as different coords in this case.

    Takes multiple type argument: under multiplication Fields commute with Gr and AxGr (Coord is transformed to Gr). Multiplication with int and float leads to multiplication of the ndarray in the value attribute.

    Args:
      other: (int, float,Gr, AxGr, Coord, Field) right multiplicant (with self)

    Returns: 
      Field.

    Raises:
      typeError if argument of the wrong type.

def concatenate(fields, ax=None, name_suffix='_cat', new_coord_name = 'gamma', new_coord= None, strings = None ):
  """
  Joins a sequence of Field objects together.

  concatenate((a1,a2,...),ax=None)
       
  The Field value ndarrays (a1.value, a2.value etc.) must have the same shape, except in the direction of concatenation if that direction is present in the grid (i.e. if the fields are defined on a grid where one of the Coord elements points in that direction).
  Default behaviour (CASE A0) is when ax = None: then, the concatenate function picks the concatenation direction as the first direction with unequal Coord values (indicating pieces of a dimension). For instance, SAT1.shape is (50,100) and SAT2.shape is (50,100), and index 0 Coord has different values for each, would concatenate to shape (100,100) by concatenating along index 0. 

CASES A, for ax not None. In the trivial case where argument ax is already in grid directions (in Field.grid.axis(), CASE A1), and the Field grids (a1.grid, a2.grid etc.) all have equal Coord member in that direction, the last Field is returned: don't use this, as there is no point in using concatenate here. (As per Field.cat method.)
Alternatively, if ax is not in grid directions, a new Coord object is created by the concatenate function, with default name "gamma" (CASE A2). For this, the new_coord argument needs to be None (its default), see CASE B.( if none of the grid member Coord objects' axis point in the direction of the ax argument (e.g. X,Y in the grid, vs Z for ax). The default Coord name can be changed by setting the  new_coord_name argument. The strings argument allows string names to be set for the points in the new Coord. This is useful for instance when the new Coord represents experiments.
  
CASE B. The above behaviour is overridden if the "new_coord" argument (not None) is provided (CASE B). This is a Coord object that will be used to construct a new Field from the fields list argument. The list elements become slices (at single Coord values) and the new_coord values are the corresponding coordinates.

  Args:
    fields: (container of Field objects, e.g. list) Field objects to concat.
    ax: (Gr) axis along which to concatenate, optional.
    name_suffix: (str) suffix to use for returned Field object name
    new_coord_name: (str) name to be used for creation of new Coord in case ax not in Field grid
    new_coord: (Coord) overrides default behaviour if set by concatenating along that new Coord.
    strings: (container of strings) used as strings argument in Coord creation with new_coord_name

  Returns:
    The concatenated Field.

  Raises:
    ValueError if Field sequence is empty or, if new_coord is not None, if the Field list is of unequal length to new_coord. 

  Examples:
  
  Obtain X,Y,.. for project P via:

  >>> for c in P['DPO'].axes:
  >>> exec c.name + ' = c'

  CASE A0:

  >>> SAT = P['DPO']['A_sat']
  >>> SAT1 = SAT[Y,:50]
  >>> SAT2 = SAT[Y,50:]
  >>> SAT_combined = sg.concatenate([SAT1,SAT2 ] )
  >>> SAT_combined.shape # we get the old Field back via automatic Y-concatenation
  (100, 100)

  CASE A2: ax not in grid.axis(), a new Coord will be created

  >>> SAT = P['DPO']['A_sat']
  >>> SAT1 = SAT[Y,:50]
  >>> SAT2 = SAT[Y,50:]
  >>> W = sg.Ax('W') # Create test Ax axis to concatenate along.
  >>> SAT_combined = sg.concatenate([SAT1,SAT2 ], ax = W )

  (2,50,100)
  >>> SAT_combined.grid
  (gamma, latitude_sliced, longitude)
  >>> SAT_combined.grid[0].value  # a new Coord has been created
  array([0, 1])

  CASE B: use new_coord to create new grid

  >>> SAT = P['DPO']['A_sat']
  >>> SAT1 = SAT[Y,:50]
  >>> SAT2 = SAT[Y,50:]
  >>> W = sg.Ax('W') # Create test Ax axis to concatenate along, and Coord:
